            question: "How to reach Kedarnath from Bhilai?",
            answer: "The most reliable way is taking the 18237 Chhattisgarh Express from Durg (Bhilai) to Haridwar (28 hrs). From Haridwar, take a pre-booked cab to Sonprayag (8 hrs). The fastest way is flight from Raipur (RPR) to Dehradun (DED) followed by a 4-hr cab ride. Avoid direct driving as the 1,500km route via Nagpur-Jhansi is exhausting."
        },
        distance: {
            question: "What is the exact distance from Bhilai to Kedarnath?",
            answer: "The journey involves two legs: 1) Bhilai to Haridwar is approx 1,350 km by rail or road. 2) Haridwar to Gaurikund (base camp) is 235 km by hilly road. The final leg is a 16 km steep trek from Gaurikund to Kedarnath Temple. Total door-to-door distance is approx 1,600 km."
        },
        cost: {
            question: "What is the real cost of Kedarnath Yatra from Bhilai?",
            answer: "A realistic budget for 2026 starts at ₹12,500/person for sleeper train + dorm stay. Comfortable standard packages (3AC Train + Hotel) average ₹18,500 - ₹22,000. Helicopter packages cost ₹45,000+ due to high demand and surge pricing."
        },
        bestTime: {
            question: "When should Bhilai residents visit Kedarnath?",
            answer: "May-June is ideal to escape Bhilai's 45°C heat, but expect crowds. September-October offers the clearest views and fewer crowds. We strongly advise against July-August due to landslide risks in Uttarakhand, even if the monsoon is mild in Chhattisgarh."
